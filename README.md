# ith Day Of

ith Day Of is an Android app that keeps track of the number of days since a user-entered day. Like
[Room Notes](https://github.com/jaradgray/RoomNotes),
it uses
[AndroidX](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/)
libraries and
[Android architecture components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/)
to implement the
[recommended app architecture](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/docs/guide#recommended-app-arch).

## Featured Components

Like

ith Day Of features the following Android components:
